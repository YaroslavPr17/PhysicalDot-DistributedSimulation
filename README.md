# PhysicalDot-DistributedSimulation

## Solving a system of ordinary differential equations

### Setting the task

Given $N$ material points with masses $m_k$, whose positions at the initial moment of time are given by radius vectors $r_k$, and velocities by vectors $v_k$, $k = \overline{1, N}$. It is required to determine the trajectories of all particles at all time points from $0$ to $t_{end}$.

### Input format
The program is given a file with the masses, initial coordinates and velocities of all material points.
The first line of the file consists of a single number `n` â€” the number
of dots.

### Output format
A `csv` file, each line of which
has the following format:

## Received solutions
Several solutions have been obtained [iterative](https://github.com/YaroslavPr17/PhysicalDot-DistributedSimulation/blob/development/src/single_thread.c) , [parallel with threads reassignment](https://github.com/YaroslavPr17/PhysicalDot-DistributedSimulation/blob/development/src/multi_thread_repeated_threading.c) , [parallel without threads reassignment](https://github.com/YaroslavPr17/PhysicalDot-DistributedSimulation/blob/development/src/multi_thread.c) Visualization was also created, studies of the speed of execution of various solutions were conducted and numerical characteristics were measured, such as *acceleration* and *efficiency*.

## Conclusions on working with multithreading
* The minimum execution time is achieved with the largest number of program threads;
* Threads, the number of which is many times higher than the number of processor cores, make a minimal contribution to the acceleration of calculations;
* For a large number of threads, there is an obvious overhead in time;
* Hyper Threading technology allows you to increase computing performance by 33% (with 12 active system threads instead of 6);
* After a certain threshold, the efficiency remains unchanged as the amount of data increases.
